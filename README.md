You find yourself alone … lost in the woods. There are scattered debris about, and you feel good about picking some up for protection.

To Play: Find weapons and ammo underneath rocks to fight the KILLER CLOWN that is coming to eat you. Three rounds, each increasing in difficulty. If you don’t find the right matches, you’ll be lost forever.
